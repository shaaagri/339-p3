                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <p>This was the first major assignment of the course (2
                        weeks to complete), and its prompt was to create a simple 3D
                        environment in Unity that is walkable in first-person
                        perspective.<br><br>
                        As it's often the case, I didn't really know where to
                        start, so first I tried to list what are the key goals I
                        have (required by the assignment):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Need to use Terrain tool (a feature in Unity for
                            quick modeling of landscapes).</li>
                        <li>Need to have trees, outdoor lighting, and fog.</li>
                        <li>Need to have audio sources, and a few simple
                            buildings somewhere, modeled from scratch.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Besides a couple of more small requirements, the rest
                        was left to students (yes, a lot of creative freedom).
                        So I tried to think what also <em>I</em> would like to
                        see in this environment:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The use of Terrain and other assets should make
                            total sense and feel integrated. It is easy to just
                            check the boxes dropping things randomly, but I did not
                            want that.</li>
                        <li>The scene should be interesting, captivating,
                            inciting to explore it.</li>
                        <li>There should be some overall theme, or mood.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Armed with that "roadmap", I began crafting the scene.
                        Obviously, the Terrain was the largest part of this
                        scene and really the foundation of it, so first I tried
                        to sculpt some hills and mountains, hoping to get a
                        clearer picture of the scene I want in the process.
                        Initially, I was imagining some kind of Arizona/Utah
                        desert, with an Interstate highway cutting through it,
                        and, maybe, a gas station.
                    </p>
                    <div class="example-block">
                        <img src="img/work/project1/001_terrain_basic.jpg"
                            alt="screenshot from unity with a basic terrain">
                    </div>
                    <p>I eschewed the assignment's recommendation of using
                        smaller landscapes because I felt what I'm really after here
                        is that sense of being small in larger surroundings, with
                        tall mountains at the horizon, etc.<br><br>
                        I decided one scene's corner will be a flat lowland and
                        the main area where I will put the most of the required
                        assets, and where the player is going to be spawned
                        first. The opposite corner was turned into a supertall
                        mountain (maxed out the Terrain's possible heights,
                        actually), to serve as a contrast to the main area, and
                        as the "architectural dominant" for the whole scene.</p>
                    <div class="example-block">
                        <img src="img/work/project1/002_terrain_far_peak.jpg" alt="screenshot from unity with a ground level view of a
                        tall peak">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Next, I began to work out the dense forest that in my
                        vision should have been separating the two corners. This
                        was when I realized I want the scene to be actually set
                        at night, allowing for a more mysterious, "what's
                        lurking behind" feel - somewhat surreal and a bit
                        childish even. A very long browsing process had
                        followed, until I found a perfect skybox.
                    </p>
                    <div class="example-block">
                        <img src="img/work/project1/003_starry_night_skybox.jpg"
                            alt="borrowed 2d asset example - a starry skybox">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Now, having a more salient visual direction allowed me
                        to quickly come up with ideas for the lighting and fog
                        parts. I rearranged and fleshed out the terrain,
                        carefully distributing trees to create a natural look.
                        Some areas remained a desert, while others became dense,
                        lush forests (I really wanted this variety to keep the
                        scene interesting for exploration).
                    </p>
                    <div class="example-block">
                        <img src="img/work/project1/004_new_night_terrain.jpg" alt="screenshot from unity with the fleshed out terrain
                        set at night">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Once that was done, I only needed to flesh out the main
                        area where the player spawns. I finely sculpted the
                        terrain here a bit more to get a feeling of the space I
                        wanted, and put some foliage.
                    </p>
                    <div class="example-block">
                        <img src="img/work/project1/005_main_area.jpg" alt="screenshot from unity with the main area and
                        foliage">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        I still felt very attracted to my initial idea, though,
                        of the road stop at a gas station - so next I modeled
                        and textured a convenience store and gas pumps in Unity
                        ProBuilder. I decided the scene, in the end, will play
                        out as if there was some person travelling through this
                        zone, which got abandoned and desolated due to some
                        slowly unfolding paranormal accident.
                    </p>
                    <div class="example-block">
                        <img src="img/work/project1/006_gas_station.jpg"
                            alt="screenshot from unity with the gas station and convenience store">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        I deliberately chose a retro, 70s look when texturing
                        the station, to underscore that subtle surreal touch.
                    </p>
                    <div class="example-block">
                        <img src="img/work/project1/007_gas_pump.jpg"
                            alt="screenshot from unity showing retro look of the gas pumps">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The lighting also became very fitting for the mood I was
                        after. I enhanced it further with an electronic remix of
                        a kids song <em>"Clouds, Like a Little White
                            Horses"</em> from a classic Russian cartoon, playing
                        from an old radio. Together with the ambient wind
                        whooshing sounds, it gave the scene more of that
                        desolated, fragile, and a little heart-aching mood.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I also carefully selected and added ambient sounds for the forest, one can hear them upon
                        entering the most dense area.

                        The woods are important for the narrative, because they
                        are the origin of the cold that consumes the region. I
                        was somewhat inspired by Twin Peaks that similarly
                        employed the "evil in the woods" trope - the <a
                            href="https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Glastonbury_Grove">Glastonbury
                            Grove</a>, in particular. To reinforce the narrative and
                        make the forest area more interesting, I added, as a
                        last touch, a creepy pit with a pool that illuminates
                        trees and emits disturbing sounds. It's' probably better
                        to stay away from it :)

                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>Before this assignment, I had very limited experience
                        with Unity, so it was my first major experience with the
                        engine. The requirement to use the built-in ProBuilder
                        instead of familiar Maya was particularly challenging. I
                        also had to learn a lot about the Unity basics before being
                        able to make anything useful.<br><br>
                        However, once I got the learning done, everything
                        started to come together and, in the end, I enjoyed the
                        result very much. The assignment made me prepared for
