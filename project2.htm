                        (the previous one was covered <a href="project1.htm">here</a>), I loosely recreated the
                        King's Cross railway station in London, which, among
                        other things, is famous as Harry Potter's departure
                        point on his way to Hogwarts.

                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <p>Due to the open-ended nature of our assignments in that
                        course, the most challenging stage was, again, coming up
                        with the initial concept for the scene. I looked up at the
                        brief and remembered my friend mentioning Harry Potter
                        series in our talk. I started to think about what related to
                        that theme can I make that meets the requirements, and
                        landed on the King's Cross. This is mostly because modeling
                        a railway station seemed pretty straightforward to me,
                        compared to other landmarks from the HP universe.<br /><br />To get the reference, I went to
                        watch the scene from one
                        of the old Harry Potter movies, where Harry goes to the
                        Platform 9Â¾ for the first time.
                    </p>
                    <div class="example-block-video">
                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KWcxgrg4eQI"
                            title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write;
                        encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <p>From there, I was able to estimate the amount of work,
                        which did not seem bad - the architecture of the station is
                        quite repetitive. I went to collect more photos shot inside
                        the King's Cross from various angles.</p>
                    <div class="example-block">
                        <img src="img/work/project2/001_refs.jpg" alt="screenshot from windows explorer with reference
                        photos collected">
                    </div>
                    <p>Not only I gathered enough material to model after, these
                        photos were also later used to make flat textures out of
                        their cut parts.<br /><br /> I began to model only to run
                        into a frustrating challenge - Maya was allowed this time,
                        but it refused to launch on my computer. Due to a tight
                        deadline, I had to fall back to the Unity ProBuilder, which
                        is far less powerful. Nonetheless, after watching LinkedIn
                        Lynda tutorials I figured out the tools I needed, more or
                        less. I eschewed any further planning and just dived into
                        making the things, starting with train platforms.</p>
                    <div class="example-block">
                        <img src="img/work/project2/002_standalone_platform.jpg"
                            alt="screenshot from unity showing a train platform being modeled">
                    </div>
                    <p>Afterwards, I began to meticulously model the walls of
                        King's Cross, borrowing textures where appropriate, or using
                        Photoshop to make ones out of reference images. All the
                        scales and proportions were just eyeballed.</p>
                    <div class="example-block">
                        <img class="smaller" src="img/work/project2/003_standalone_wall.jpg"
                            alt="screenshot from unity showing a wall segment">
                    </div>
                    <p>I just duplicated this segment to get the actual wall,
                        altering textures of some to imitate side entrances. The
                        roof and adjacent parts were very tricky to make. I
                        eventually got away by using ProBuilder's Arch tool,
                        seamlessly connecting various pieces, and then duplicating
                        everything once again.</p>
                    <div class="example-block">
                        <img class="smaller" src="img/work/project2/004_wall_plus_arches.jpg" alt="screenshot from unity showing a wall with roof
                        arches">
                    </div>
                    <p>From there, I prepared a roof texture and used the Arch
                        tool with different parameters to insert glass panels into
                        the roof.</p>
                    <div class="example-block">
                        <img class="smaller" src="img/work/project2/005_glass_roof.jpg"
                            alt="screenshot from unity showing glass roof">
                    </div>
                    <p>I continued to fill in details, such as these platform
                        stands and the sunny lighting.</p>
                    <div class="example-block">
                        <img src="img/work/project2/006_stands.jpg"
                            alt="screenshot from stands next to a train platform">
                    </div>
                    <p>The assignment had us integrate at least one borrowed
                        model, and create a particle system somewhere. I unified
                        these two requirements by placing a diesel locomotive with a
                        thick smoke (I've done it using the Unity's Visual Effect
                        Graph) coming from its exhaust.</p>
                    <div class="example-block-video">
                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/18wrmNN9bTw"

                    </div>
                    <p>The assignment also had us practice collision detectors,
                        so I came up with this improvised scene where some clumsy
                        porter let oranges come out of cargo boxes. If you step on
                        them, they get squished with a sound, leaving a splash on
                        the floor. The same happens if a cart nearby rolls over
                        them. All of this was coded in C#.</p>
                    <div class="example-block-video">
                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yz9EKChS-JU"

                    </div>
                    <p>One more requirement was to use a hinge joint somewhere,
                    so I made this storeroom with a door on hinges that squeaks
                    if it swings too hard (just wrote a script that checks the
                    door's angular velocity).</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>I also modeled the catwalk that can be seen in the
                        reference video - Harry walks on it with Hagrid. As the
                        final touch, I added the actual transition to the magical
                        Platform 9Â¾. Except there is no owl in the cart.</p>

                    <p>I had a lot of fun doing this project. I still feel
                        it was somewhat too ambitious trying to recreate the whole
                        station, though - I ended up with just an approximation. However, I
                        feel happy that none of the challenges I faced had become
                        real obstacles - rather they just posited questions I had to find
                        creative answers to.</p>
